		    	Builders of Future Africa (B.F.A.) is a non-governmental organization registered by the government of Tanzania act of 2002 under registration number00NGO/0009237 to operate in Tanzania main land and accredited by the International Youth Federation (IYF) with accreditation number AO/001213 for regional and International accreditation.
		    	<hr>
				The aim of the organization is to build a prosperous Africa by restoring hope to children who have lost it and helping them meet their own essential needs. The organization was established by passionate youth in 2012 in Arusha (who were A-level students at Cornerstone Leadership Academy by then) after observing high levels of poverty and the low life standards of children in the local communities which has consequently led to problems such as lack of scholastic materials,poor parental care,lack of food, shelter and clothing as well as horrifying life testimonies. All these problems combined called for a collective effort to come up with solutions thus the birth of Builders of Future Africa (B.F.A).
				<hr>
				B.F.A is currently sponsoring over 150 children and out of them 30 are being fully sponsored and the rest are partially sponsored. The sponsorship covers for the school uniforms, scholastic materials, school fees as well as health insurance on annual basis. Other forms of support include academic assistance and character development programs alongside fun games, sports and consultations which take place every Saturday evening at the Academyâ€™s campus. Recently, the organization has extended its works to other cities such as Dar es Salaam, Morogoro and Dodoma with the growing number of members as well as well-wishers across the country.

This takes a day to be processed at a cost that is included in the tuition fee and it is processed before course delegate(s) arrives in Swaziland. All public/ scheduled programmes include hospitality tours within Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa or Swaziland. These countries are visa free for Tanzania Citizens. We advise all delegates from other countries to consult the respective embassies in their home countries for visa formalities before leaving for Swaziland.</p>

		            <p>The official currency in Swaziland is a Swazi Lilangeni (SZL) which is an equivalent to a South African Rand (ZAR). The South African currency is also used in Swaziland. People coming to Swaziland from overseas generally find the cost of living comparatively low due to the depreciated local currency. Restaurant prices vary depending on the type of establishment. A good meal for one at an average restaurant costs around R150, top category establishments can cost up to R200. These prices are based on one course and a soft drink or a beer. However, hotels and restaurants charge tax in addition to the prices shown for meals and accommodation. Although most prices are tax inclusive, services are also subject to VAT at a rate of 15%.</p>
