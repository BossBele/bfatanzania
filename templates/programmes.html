			    	We occasionally take time to visit children at their homes as a way of sharing and spreading love and in doing so we encourage parents and guardians to let their children take part on our Saturday program which usually takeplace at the school grounds of Cornerstone Leadership Academy every Saturday. Through these outreaches we are able to examine the impact of our works based on the feedback we get from the community. We normally carry out these outreaches from around 8:00 am to 6:30pm so that we can have ample time to have conversations as well as fun time with the community and particularly the children as we visit them. In these outreaches the members of the organization are part and parcel therefore, we usually go in big numbers from around fifty people or more.

					Some villages that we have been visiting are Lengijave, Lemanyatta, Lenjani, Olmotonyi, Mukulat, Mwandet, Oltrumet as well as the schools in those areas.

					Besides reaching out to communities we also take time to do works of charity by directly reaching out to needy children and offering them some of their basic needs. In doing so we visit orphanage centers and children wards in hospitals whereas we bring them gift packs with things like food, clothes, soaps as well as medical needs. We do this in various regions under the supervision of our regional offices trustees.

			    	This is a program which we conduct every Saturday whereby children come together to learn, play and be inspired. We teach them Leadership and character development, personal hygiene alongside academic subjects such as Mathematics and English. We also take time to talk to them, hear what they have to say and to know what challenges they face especially the girls. In our conversations we remind them of their worth and value, we encourage them to believe in themselves and we also inspire them to reach out to their dreams and be their very best. We finally get to play with them exchange smiles and create deeper bonds.

					            <p>
					            	A gift on christmas is a reminder of love and love is the basic ingredient and the essence of every package we wrap up for every child to open. As we preach love to the children we first show them through loving acts and Chritmas gifts have proven to be one of the best ways to do so. As B.F.A we offer gift packs on Christmas for every child we have registered under the organization as a way of attending to their needs in a loving manner and in an epic season to do so.

                    	Education, nurturing skills and talents of a child are among huge priorities in their life for both a boy and a girl child. Builders of Future Africa being an organization that considers children as source of their strength has not left the girl child behind. For many years a girl child’s security and right to education has not been guaranteed at all levels beginning from the family. Despite that now more than ever girls go to school, the girl child is still faced with obstacles based on gender and it’s intersections with other factors such as age, ethnicity and hindrance in enjoying quality education.
						Girls have been facing abuse and denial to education and even worse forced to stay quiet and get used to such situations. Builders of Future Africa has dedicated itself in ensuring safety for the girl by counseling her and mostly educating her on how important it is to fight for her education against all social oppositions because education is one of the essential needs for her to overcome and gain the courage to help herself and her the society in general.

                    <p>
                    	Being a girl child I know how society’s perceptions have become a limitation to a girl’s success by looking down on her, leaving her out and denying her opportunities. I know how it feels to stay home and do the chores and cook for the ones going to school (the boy children). I know how a girl can be forced and convinced that education is not for her and it will not help her. That she was born to give birth and bring up the family. I also know how outstanding a girl child can be when given the opportunity to stand up and show up in all aspects be it education, leadership and career wise among others. This is why we have decided to be in the Frontline assuring that girls get quality education and skills bringing out the best out of them for the sake of acquiring social changes in our communities. That for a girl’s life there is more than just being young wives and young mothers or house keepers, that they can have dreams and goals and very possibly achieve them if they are determined and dedicated, that they can have careers and pursue them. That their safety from all abuse and dignity matters a lot and they should not expect anything short of that.
						We are sure beyond all doubts that when given the right chances to nurture their talents and skills, girls have it in them to excel in different areas of life. It is therefore imperative that our organization works in cohesion to spread the message of saving and educating the girl child we have taken the initiative of sponsoring over 90 girls believing that investing in a girl’s education is investing in a nation andwe’re willing to take the bet!
